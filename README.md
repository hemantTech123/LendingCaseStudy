## General Information

### Project Information

> The project is a data science initiative that leverages the Lending Club dataset to predict the likelihood of loan defaults

### Project Background

> This company is the largest online loan marketplace, offering personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Borrowers can quickly access lower-interest loans through a user-friendly online platform. However, like most lending institutions, providing loans to high-risk applicants is the primary source of financial loss, known as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the amount of money the lender loses when a borrower fails to repay the loan or absconds with the owed amount. In this context, borrowers labeled as "charged-off" are considered defaulters, contributing significantly to the lender's losses.

### Project Statement

> Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

### Data Set

> The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club and data dictionary in excel file.

## Conclusions

- Major Factors to Predict Default and Mitigate Credit Loss:
1. Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.
2. Loan grades.
3. Verification status.
4. Annual income.
5. Public-record bankruptcies.
- Other Considerations for High-Risk Borrowers:
1. Borrowers not from large urban states like California, New York, Texas, or Florida.
2. Borrowers with annual incomes between $50,000 and $100,000.
3. Borrowers with a history of public-record bankruptcies.
4. Borrowers with lower grades (E, F, G), which indicate higher risk.
5. Borrowers with very high DTI ratios.
6. Borrowers with over 10 years of work experience.
